For our Code of Coduct, we are going to use the Contributor Covenant since it fits our programs usage quite well. We want anyone to add to the program if they wanted. We could perhaps expand one day in way that we have more functions like a calculator but currently we just want anyone to use our program. So an open source CoC like Contributor Covenant seems to work well with ours.
